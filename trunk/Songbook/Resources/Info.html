<h2>What is Songbook?</h2>
<p>
Songbook is an organizer of Chord Pro files, a way of storing lyrics+chords
of a song, for iPhone.
</p>
<a name="s2">
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>
The Songbook interface is really straightforward, with the buttons
on the bottom you navigate the three main areas of the program:
<ul>
<li>Browse by Artist: where you navigate your personal songbook by artist</li>
<li>Browse by Song: show all the songs in one list</li>
<li>Add Song: this is where you can add song, either by typing a chord file via the iPhone keyboard, or by trying to parse some file over the internet</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>A Shortcut</h2>
<p>If you are browsing internet and you find a chord pro file you want to add to your Songbook, you can substitute in the URL bar of Mobile Safari <code>http://</code> with <code>chordpro://</code>, this will "pass" the URL to Songbook, so you don't have to remember and rewrite it in the Add Song pane.</p>
<p>You can even add a "bookmarklet" that will do it for you, the code is:</p>
<p><code>
javascript:window.location.href
= 'chordpro' +
window.location.href.substr(4)
</code></p>
<p>Just make a bookmark with this "weird text" as location in Mobile Safari, and when you'll find some song you want to add, just click the bookmarklet and Songbook will open!</p>

<h2>Editing a Song</h2>
<p>In the Song Edit view you can edit the raw .pro file. The format is really simple: first write down the lyrics of the song, then insert between the verses the chords surrounded by square brackets.</p>
<p>Since an example is worth a thousand words: <code>Swing l[D]ow, sweet c[G]hario[D]t</code></p>
